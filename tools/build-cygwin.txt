ARAnyM compilation under Cygwin
(c) 2003-2009 Xavier Joubert for the ARAnyM team

Building ARAnyM under Cygwin is now almost identical to unix/linux. There
are just a few things to keep in mind.

- Compilation is accomplished using the Cygwin linux-like environment
  (http://www.cygwin.com/). You should use the 32 bit version (setup-x86.exe),
  even when building on a 64-bit host.
- Although the resulting executable uses cygwin's posix layer,
  the MinGW version of the SDL libraries will be used.
  
Simply create a directory where everything will be
contained. Untar ARAnyM sources in this directory. You can also pull
sources from GIT (see https://aranym.github.io/development.html for
details on how to do this).

Cygwin packages that should be installed :
- gcc-core
- gcc-g++
- mingw64-i686-SDL and/or mingw64-i686-SDL2
- make
- makedepend
- git, autoconf and automake (if you want to use GIT version, or if
  you modify configure.ac)
- cygutils (for the dos2unix tool)

If you want to compile ARAnyM with --enable-nfjpeg (NatFeat jpeg
decoder), you will also need mingw64-i686-SDL_image, mingw64-i686-SDL2_image,
or libjpeg8.

Now you can configure the build:

- If you got the source code from Git then type
  ./autogen.sh && make
  Any parameter given to autogen.sh will be forwarded to ARAnyM's
  configure script, so you can run "./autogen.sh --enable-fullmmu"
  if you want to build with MMU support. 

- If you have a source snapshot or proper ARAnyM source code release then type
  ./configure && make

./configure --help shows you all the configuration options.


You'll get your binary after a few minutes (depending on your system).
If you get errors about "\r", please run "dos2unix configure" to
convert line endings from DOS style to unix style.

If you happen to modify some sources, you can simply run "make" in the
correct directory. Please note that configure options will be ignored
in this case !

If you want to re-configure, just do a "make clean", then run configure again.

If you modify configure.ac, you have to run autogen.sh again. make or configure
won't do that for you. Don't forget to give any configure options you need !

If you want a clean rebuild from original sources, simply "make distclean"
and run configure again.

You may have to copy the MinGW SDL shared library into some directory of
your PATH before running the executable. This can usually be found as
/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin/SDL.dll

Questions about building ARAnyM should go to the developper mailing
list. See https://aranym.github.io/development.html for
